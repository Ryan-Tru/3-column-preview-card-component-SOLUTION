## Overview
  This is my solution to the 3 column preview card component.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements


## My process
  I analysed the design photos and planned out my HTML skeleton. Then I styled it with css, mainly using grid.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This challenge was a little more hard for me, as I was not as familiar with Grid than I was flexbox. This challenge helped me get more comfortable with using grid.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on grid, and get more familiar with it.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me a lot. It's a great guide for GRID and I recommend anyone that isn't familiar with grid to reference this website
